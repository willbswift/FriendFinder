Friend matching program

This is the ReadMe file for my Friend matching program node program. It was the assignment for the 12th week at Web Developer Boot Camp.  Its called FriendFinder and its supposed to use a survey to match the user with the best fit from a selection of pre-entered friends. 

To use it one goes to the Heroku hosted site https://sleepy-earth-20359.herokuapp.com/

Once there hit the "Go To Survey" button.  This will present you with a list of questions to be filled out.

Once all the questions have been answered the user hits the Submit button.

One can hit the API Friends Link at the bottom of the page to see all the other Friends and verify that the new one has been added.

Future upgrades will bring up a Modal showing the best matched friend.
